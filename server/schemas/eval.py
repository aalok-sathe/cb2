""" This file defines the Eval run schema, which is used to store the results of
    an evaluation run.

    Evals can either be remote or local. Each eval is associated with a run
    source, to know if it was run locally or remotely.

    Each eval is a list of scenarios, which are stored in the Game table. Although
    an eval can consist of many different scenarios within the same game, we
    evaluate each as a separate scenario game.

    We anticipate many eval runs, and eval runs are resource intensive. Firstly,
    evals may require many calls to the GPT API or use of a GPU. Secondly, eval
    outputs must be saved to disk, and this takes up disk space. To mitigate this,
    we default to local eval runs, and only run remote evals when specified.
